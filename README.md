Q&A:
1. **Given the provided data, what are three conclusions we can draw about Kickstarter campaigns?** 
    a. Given population size selected for the analysis, theater has the most successful kickstarters in terms of volume, but music has the most successful campaigns as a % of total per pattern category. 
    b. There seems to have been an upward trend of overall campaigns up through 2015 (it's peak), followed by a decline. The decline was mostly abrupt in 2017. 
    c. Great Britain has had the highest volume of campaigns.
3. **What are some limitations of this dataset?** 
    a. Sample size is only 1.3% of the entire campaigns size. 
    b. Also, how the data was selected is not clear (random vs a selection per category vs year, etc.). 
    c. It fails to describe if the goal was a realistic one (to measure success based on meeting the goal vs meeting what they needed) - I noticed that some had goals of $1.
5. **What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?** Box and whiskers plot, to understand distribition on goals and pledged amounts. 

# Bonus Questions
**Use your data to determine whether the mean or the median summarizes the data more meaningfully.** I would use the median, given that the sample is skewed and does not seem to be normally distributed given variance, stdev and ranges.
**Use your data to determine if there is more variability with successful or unsuccessful campaigns. Does this make sense? Why or why not?** There is more variability with the successful campaigns, though it is still high. For unsuccessful campaigns, the least number of backers would be 0, whereas successful campaigns most have at least 1. From a theoretical perspective, a good idea would attract backers, expanding the range of how many people would back it up to try and make it successful.
